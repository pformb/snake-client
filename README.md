# Multiplayer Snake Game Client

The Snake game is a beloved classic in the world of video games. It involves guiding a growing snake as it slithers around, consuming pieces of food to expand. However, with every bite, the snake becomes longer and trickier to navigate, making it increasingly challenging to avoid colliding with the game's boundaries or the snake's own tail.

The Snake Client Project introduces a multiplayer twist to this traditional gameplay.
